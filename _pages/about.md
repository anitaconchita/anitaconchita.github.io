I'm a Research & Engagement Librarian at UCSB, where I work with faculty and students in the departments of Asian American Studies, Black Studies, Global Studies, Communication, and Anthropology. I have my PhD in English (also from UCSB). Before I returned to UCSB, I was Director of Digital Scholarship at Columbia University, and University of Michigan.
