I am a Research & Engagement Librarian at UCSB Library. Previously, I was Director of Digital Scholarship at the Columbia University Libraries, and prior to that, I was at University of Michigan where I was the Director of Digital Scholarship and faculty in the Digital Studies Institute and Asian Pacific-Islander/American Studies. I’m a principle of the SCRAM Collective. I’m also a writer of speculative fiction, have two dogs, two cats, and love to eat and feed people. I’m currently at work on my first novel. I occasionally will conduct author interviews and articles.
